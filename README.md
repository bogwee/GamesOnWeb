# BABYLONJS ~~JOJO~~ 

_Hi there, this is a fun little game about climbing. If you want to play it follow the steps bellow. If you're interested in setting up your own development environment scroll down, there is a section just for that it will guide you threw the different steps._

***
### **Game Setup**
***

#### _Clone Git Repository_
``` 
git clone https://github.com/bogwee/GamesOnWeb.git
```

#### _Move to Game Directory_
```
cd GamesOnWeb
```

#### _Install Modules_
```
npm i
```

#### _Install BabylonJS Core and Loaders_
```
npm i @babylonjs/core @babylonjs/loaders
```

***
### **Development Environment Setup**
***

#### 1. Download Node.js

#### 2. _Create Project Template from Vite + Vue + TypeScript_
``` 
npm create vite@latest
```

#### 3. Type in the `Name` of your project, then chose your framework in this case its `Vue` and finally your language, `TypeScript`.

#### 4. _Move to your Project Directory_
```
cd Project-Name
```

#### 5. _Install Modules_

npm i

#### 7. Now you are ready, but I prefer to change the `Directory Structure` to the following:
```
Project-Name:.
├───assets
│   ├───environment
│   ├───images
│   ├───models
│   └───textures
├───public
